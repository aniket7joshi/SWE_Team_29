Wonderful Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba enjoys scoring for his club.
Paul Pogba will be convinced to stay at Manchester United and sign an extension to his contract, one pundit has insisted. Despite a season of huge frustration at long inactivity, Pogba has rarely found himself out of the news and his put-down of his fiercest critic – Scottish firebrand Graeme Souness – is the amusing story of the week you simply have to read. The player continues to be strongly linked with a return to previous club Juventus or Spanish giants Real Madrid and while Pogba himself has not commented on his future, he has received some recent words of encouragement from his manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. “Paul and Marcus [Rashford] have been out, now we’ve still got games left, and I think everyone in the league will start more or less on the same level,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “Maybe they’ve got more motivation to keep going now, as they can see when they’re back they may be on the same level or even a better level physically. “In a way, they have got an opportunity here to play a bigger part in this season than they had hoped. “And they are big players for us, some of the most important players.” Despite ongoing speculation suggesting he may have played his last game for the club, Sky Sports’ Spanish football expert Guillem Balague believes the player will not only stay at Old Trafford, but he will commit to a new contract to extend his second spell at the club. “Real Madrid I don’t think have Paul Pogba as a priority,” the reporter said in a YouTube video. “Paul Pogba has suggested both, that he wants to go and he wants to stay. “So he’s playing his cards but at the moment I do feel that a player like him would be better serviced to be at Manchester United where he will be the leader.
